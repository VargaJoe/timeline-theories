# Implementation Tasks

This document tracks the progress of implementing the TimelineVerse application features. Tasks are organized by story and marked with checkboxes for completion tracking.

## Completed Stories
- **Story 01 - Create New Timeline** âœ… COMPLETED (2025-07-11)
- **Story 02 - Add Media Entry to Global Library** âœ… COMPLETED (2025-01-22)

## In Progress Stories
- **Story 03 - Add Existing Media Entry to Timeline** ðŸŽ¯ READY TO START (next priority)
- [x] Technical setup: Downgraded React and types to v17, installed @sensenet/authentication-oidc-react and @material-ui/core@4.12.4 for OIDC authentication (Story 08, Story 01)
- [x] Attempted OIDC/RepositoryContext integration, but reverted to JWT-based authentication and custom AuthContext due to compatibility and type issues (Story 08, Story 01)
- [x] Removed all sensenet/JWT logic. Switched to local mock authentication and local timeline creation. App is now backend-agnostic and ready for integration with PostgreSQL or any REST API (Story 08, Story 01)
- [x] Integrated with SenseNet repository for authentication and timeline storage. Timeline creation and listing now use SenseNet repository client and OIDC authentication (Story 08, Story 01)
- [x] TypeScript import/module resolution issues fixed for TimelineListPage. Type-only import used for Timeline type. AppProviders.tsx confirmed correct for OIDC context. (2025-07-09)
- [x] App starts and loads in browser using Vite. (2025-07-09)
- [x] **STORY 01 COMPLETED**: Create New Timeline feature fully implemented and tested (2025-07-11T10:52)
    - [x] Enhanced timelineService.ts with proper error handling, TypeScript types, and robust API calls
    - [x] Improved TimelineCreateForm.tsx with form validation, success messages, professional styling, and UX
    - [x] Updated TimelineViewPage.tsx to display complete timeline details with proper loading states and navigation
    - [x] Enhanced TimelineListPage.tsx with modern grid layout, better styling, and improved user experience
    - [x] All timeline CRUD operations working seamlessly with SenseNet backend
    - [x] Complete flow: Form validation â†’ SenseNet API â†’ Success feedback â†’ Redirect to timeline view
    - [x] Timeline viewing and listing functionality fully operational
- [ ] **NEW: Public timeline browsing and UI improvements** (High priority, branch: feature/public-timeline-browsing-and-ui-improvements, started 2025-07-07T19:22:22+02:00)
    - [x] Allow unauthenticated users to browse timelines
    - [x] Only require login for timeline creation or editing
    - [x] Add a login button, do not auto-initiate login
    - [x] Improve form and input styling for better UX âœ… COMPLETED
    - [x] Fix error on timeline creation (investigate backend/frontend integration) âœ… COMPLETED
    - [x] Fix error: Failed to load timelines (investigate backend API and integration) âœ… COMPLETED
    - [x] Add debug logging to LoginButton.tsx to inspect OIDC state and diagnose loading issue (2025-07-09)
    - [x] Add top-level console.log to LoginButton.tsx to confirm component rendering for OIDC debug (2025-07-09)
    - [x] Inject OIDC access token into repository client on login/logout (2025-07-09)
    - [x] Move OIDC token injection to OidcTokenInjector inside provider context (fixes useOidcAuthentication error) (2025-07-09)
    - [x] **Successfully started client app** - Resolved dependency conflicts by downgrading React to v17.0.2 and installing @material-ui/core@4.12.4. App running on http://localhost:5173/ (2025-07-10T22:21)
    - [x] **Fixed OIDC login button loading issue** - Removed persistent loading state that prevented login button from showing. Login button now appears immediately and is clickable (2025-07-10T22:35)
    - [x] **Fixed logout navigation issue** - Implemented complete local logout to avoid external identity server redirect. Uses manual storage clearing and page refresh instead of OIDC redirect logout (2025-07-10T23:05)
    - [x] **SECURITY CLEANUP COMPLETED** - Removed all sensitive SenseNet OIDC credentials from GitHub by replacing hardcoded values in configuration.ts with environment variables. Created .env.example template and local .env file. Authentication guide updated with secure examples for AI agents (2025-07-10T23:15)
    - [ ] **LOGOUT TOKEN PERSISTENCE ISSUE** - After implementing logout token clearing fix, app still automatically logs in without re-authentication. Enhanced logout clears all OIDC storage keys and repository tokens, but cached authentication state persists somewhere. Root cause investigation needed for OIDC provider token caching or userManager state persistence (2025-07-10T23:31)
    - [ ] **IMPLEMENT SNBOOKING LOGOUT SOLUTION** - Found proven IdentityServer logout pattern in SNBooking repository (commit 40c23a5f78). Their working pattern: localStorage.clear() -> logout().then(() => sessionStorage.clear()). This approach clears tokens first, uses official logout flow, then clears session storage. Need to test this proven solution (2025-07-11T10:30)

## Notes
- Stories are ordered by suggested implementation priority
- High priority stories form the core MVP functionality
- Medium priority stories enhance user experience
- Low priority stories are nice-to-have features
- Dependencies should be completed before starting dependent stories
- Each task should be tested before marking as complete
