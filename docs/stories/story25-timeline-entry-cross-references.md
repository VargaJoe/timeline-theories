# Story 25 - Timeline Entry Cross-References (Multi-Timeline Linking)

## User Story
**US025 – Timeline Entry Cross-References**
> As a user, I want to link a timeline entry to its counterpart(s) in other timelines, so I can easily navigate between related events across different timelines or universes.

## Acceptance Criteria
